I understand that you've looked into JWT tokens before, but they can be tricky to grasp at first. 
Let me break it down with an example you might find relatable:

Imagine you're at a fancy restaurant. To get access to the exclusive VIP area, you need a special token. 
This token isn't just any plastic card; it's a JWT token. Here's how it works:

The Token:

It's like a tiny, encrypted message containing your information: name, reservation details, dietary 
restrictions (like claims in a JWT).
Only the restaurant (issuer) and you (authorized recipient) can understand it.
It's signed by a secret key the restaurant keeps hidden (like a digital signature). 
This ensures no one can tamper with the message.

Using the Token:

You show the token to the bouncer (verifier).
The bouncer checks the signature with the restaurant's secret key, confirming it's genuine.
They decode the message to see your information (claims) and verify you're on the VIP list.
If everything checks out, you get access to the VIP area!

We need middlware to verify JWT-token.
